# skeletonema_pop_gen
skeletonema marinoi population genetics

In this repository, I list all the commands and analyses performed with the skeletonema sediment core data.

The analyses are divided into three parts:

First I did a population comparison using the Popoolation2 pipeline.
Then, I did an individual-based analysis on some strains that had been sequenced to greater depth, using GATK.

Details can be found in the subfolders.
